    action: all three committees concluded that no specific action was warranted,
      partly because many of the contested activities were legal in Louisiana at that
      time and partly due to a lack of evidence (often resulting from questionable
      campaign finance recordkeeping practices). Thus, both Long and Overton retained
      their seats.
